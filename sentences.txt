Positive airway pressure (PAP) is a mode of respiratory ventilation used in the treatment of sleep apnea.
PAP ventilation is also commonly used for those who are critically ill in hospital with respiratory failure,
in newborn infants (neonates), and for the prevention and treatment of atelectasis in patients with difficulty
taking deep breaths.

Arachnula is a genus of amoeboid eukaryotes first described by Leon Cienkowski in 1876.
Its phylogenetic position is a subject of some controversy. David Bass and colleagues considered it to be
a vampyrellid within the Endomyxa clade of Rhizaria,[3] and the SSU rDNA sequence isolated from an organism
described as Arachnula impatiens is indeed very close to that of the vampyrellid Theratromyxa.

Particle Fever is a 2013 American documentary film tracking the first round of experiments at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) near Geneva, Switzerland. The film follows the experimental physicists at the European Organization
for Nuclear Research (CERN) who run the experiments, as well as the theoretical physicists who attempt to provide
a conceptual framework for the LHC's results.

In cryptography, a substitution cipher is a method of encrypting in which units of plaintext are replaced with
the ciphertext, in a defined manner, with the help of a key; the "units" may be single letters (the most common),
pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. The receiver deciphers the text by
performing the inverse substitution process to extract the original message.

In cryptography, encryption (more specifically, encoding) is the process of transforming information in a way
that, ideally, only authorized parties can decode. This process converts the original representation of the
information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Despite its goal, encryption
does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
